### Hello there üëã
My name is Maximos (Max) and I was born and raised in Chania, Crete, Greece, Europe, EMEA, just kidding... (but really, I was born in Chania).</br>
At university I studied Chemical Engineering but got attracted to programming and Computer Science (CS) gradually won my heart; thus I am attending a CS MSc degree at the moment.</br>
I've been working with Python üêç as a Software Engineer since 2021.

### Languages of choice
* Python
* C
* C++
* Go


## I am interested in
### Web programming
I like creating microservices with Python and Go [(sample)](https://github.com/Maxcode123/airlineapi).</br>
I'd like to practice a bit of socket programming, so my TODO project-list includes creating my own database server application either in C or Go and a client for it in Python probably. 

### Compilers
#### Yes, compilers
I am genuinely interested in programming languages and how they provide us with tools to express logic. This is why I am creating (with C++) a compiler of my own for a language I call [classic](https://github.com/Maxcode123/classic).</br>
I've also built (with C) an [SLR parser](https://github.com/Maxcode123/mylang) for a very simple language.

### Testing
I believe testing is a requirement for producing quality software and I would like to get better at it.

### A bit of DevOps
I kinda enjoy building images, running containers, setting up pipelines for deployment.

## Other interests
Do you really care? üòÑ
